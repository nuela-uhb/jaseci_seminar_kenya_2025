Learning repository for  Generative AI Applications program with Dr.Jason Mars :Decentralizing  Ai innovation
This repository contains practical and learning projects running concurently with the Generative AI Seminar.  
It demonstrates hands-on learning and integration of *Jac and Python* in building, where i created a simple Habit Tracker project.


Project: Habit Tracker (Jac + Python Integration)

Purpose:  
Practice building a habit tracking application using Jac programming language integrated with Python, demonstrating both programming and AI application workflow understanding.

Project Description: 
- Users enter a habit to track for 7 days.  
- Daily prompts ask whether the habit was completed.  
- Provides encouraging messages based on user input.  
- Demonstrates Jacâ€™s syntax and logic structures working alongside Python for input/output handling.

Code Example:
```jac
with entry {
    habit = input("Enter one habit you want to track this week: ");
    print("Great! You chose to work on:", habit);

    for day in range(7){
        print("Day", day + 1);
        action = input("Did you work on your habit today? (yes/no): ");

        if action == "yes"{
            print("Awesome! Keep it up! ðŸŽ‰");}
        elif action == "no"{
            print("No worries! Tomorrow is a new day. ðŸŒŸ");}
        else{
            print("Please answer with 'yes' or 'no'.");
}
```
Environment Setup

1. Install Python (Version 3.11+ recommended).


2. Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv


3. Activate the environment:

Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate


4. Install Jac:

pip install jaclang


5. Open VS Code â†’ select the Python interpreter from the activated environment.


6. Run the Habit Tracker code inside VS Code terminal.
   





Learning Outcomes
